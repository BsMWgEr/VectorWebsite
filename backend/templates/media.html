<h3>To Upload a File:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Click the button labeled 'browse' below</li>
    <li>Select a file (or multiple files) to upload</li>
</ol>
<h3>After following the 2 steps above you will have uploaded the selected file(s) to your Websites main public storage (aka Amazon Cloud). This File is instantly
viewable from the link provided after uploading. At the same time, this will automatically create a new database item under the Media section
    which (located in the left sidebar on the Admin) is attachable to any Inventory Item.
    You can attach an Image or Confirmation-Report by navigating to the Build/Update page, if creating a new item: selecting it from the dropdown
    in the Build Form on the left side of the Build/Update page; Or, by updating an already created item: click the Update Picture or Update Confirmation Report button
    located along the top of page under the nav-bar (Newly uploaded items automatically propagate labeled as the file name you upload with .. example --> 'new_image.jpg'
    gets stored as 'new_image.jpg') You can find this Image information under the Media section on the left side of your admin page. Also, all
    Images and Confirmation Reports located in the Cloud are listed below.</h3>
